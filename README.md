# XJTU_Business_Statstic
For my project for business statistic class and to build the portfolio, I made this repository

We researched if the OTT platform's availability affects the IMDB ratings of Moive.
For this, I collected the movie data from various sources and then combined it together for analyzing it.

Our research model can be found on the link below

This repository includes

1) How I collect the data 
2) How do I combine the whole data 
3) Analysis of the data following our hypothesis 
4) Make a prediction model if some movies will sucess or not

I did this project with my classmate, Chanisa
