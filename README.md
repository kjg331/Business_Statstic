For my project of business statistic class and build the portfolio, I made this repository

We researched if the availibity of OTT paltform affects to the IMDB ratings of moive.
For this, I collected the movie data from various sources, and then combine it together for analzing it.

Our research model can be found on the link below

I will add code of

1) How I collect the data 
2) How I combine the whole data 
3) Analysis the data follow to our hypothesis 
4) Make a predicition model if some moives will sucess or not

I did this project with my classmate, Chanisa
